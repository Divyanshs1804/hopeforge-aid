### Phase 3: RAG Query Engine Edge Functions
4. **rag-query**: General natural language search across all health data ✅
5. **child-specific-query**: Child-scoped AI assistant with conversation memory ✅
6. **match_health_embeddings**: Vector similarity search database function ✅

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration
7. **AIChat Component**: Reusable streaming chat interface ✅
8. **UploadReport.tsx**: Real file upload with progress tracking ✅
9. **Dashboard.tsx**: AI assistant dialog for general queries ✅
10. **ChildProfile.tsx**: Child-specific AI assistant sidebar ✅

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Vector Database**: Supabase pgvector (1536 dimensions)
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small via Lovable AI
- **LLM**: Google gemini-2.5-flash (FREE until Oct 13!)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage with RLS
- **Edge Functions**: 4 functions deployed and configured
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with streaming SSE support

## 📡 API Endpoints

All edge functions are deployed and accessible:
- `POST /upload-health-report` - Upload health documents
- `POST /process-document` - Process uploaded documents (background)
- `POST /rag-query` - General AI queries across all data
- `POST /child-specific-query` - Child-scoped AI queries with context

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 5)

### Data Seeding
1. Migrate mock children data to database
2. Create sample health reports
3. Upload test documents
4. Load medical knowledge base

### Testing
1. Test document upload flow
2. Verify embedding generation
3. Test vector search accuracy
4. Validate AI responses
5. Test conversation memory
6. Performance testing

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Upload a Health Report
1. Navigate to Child Profile
2. Click "Upload Report"
3. Drag-and-drop or select file
4. Fill in metadata (name, date, type)
5. Submit - processing starts automatically

### Query the AI Assistant

**Dashboard (General Queries)**:
- "Which children need vaccines this month?"
- "Show me all allergy reports"
- "What health checkups were completed?"

**Child Profile (Specific Queries)**:
- "Does this child have any allergies?"
- "When is the next vaccine due?"
- "What was the last health checkup?"

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ RLS policies on storage bucket
- ✅ Service role key for backend operations
- ✅ CORS configured for all edge functions
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- ✅ Secure file storage paths

## 💡 Important Notes

- All Gemini models are FREE until Oct 13, 2025
- Edge functions are auto-deployed with code changes
- Vector search threshold set to 0.7 (adjustable)
- Chunk size: 400 characters (optimized for context)
- Top-K results: 5 chunks (configurable)
